# Project Proposal
The UEFA Champions League (UCL) is the most prestigious club competition in world football. While pundits often analyze a team's success based on luck or individual player quality, a deeper understanding requires a data-driven, historical perspective. To truly define the drivers of success and failure in the UCL, this project will analyze the statistical patterns, results, and trends that have emerged over decades.

My motivation for this topic stems from a desire to challenge common narratives. This project moves beyond a simple "who won" analysis to investigate the 'how' and 'why' behind historical outcomes. It operates on the hypothesis that success in elite sports is not purely a matter of coincidence, nor is it solely dictated by financial power, as is often assumed. Rather, this project seeks to demonstrate that UCL success is the measurable result of effective tactics, consistent on-pitch performance, and superior statistical profiles.

By exploring the patterns of teams that successfully navigate the tournament versus those that fail, this project will attempt to identify the tangible, data-backed markers of a championship-caliber team.


# Data to be used
Generally, I am using data from 
- https://fbref.com/en/comps/8/history/Champions-League-Seasons
- https://www.transfermarkt.com/uefa-champions-league/teilnehmer/pokalwettbewerb/CL


-Countries of the teams and teams qualified for round of 16
-The amount of wins and losses of the winner team in the finals


# Questions
How many teams do each country have in champions league and how many of them were able to? which country is the most successful?
Was the winner team always the best in group stage?
What statistics make a team best in the group stage or in two leg system?
How much budget do a good club spend per year and did it actually work?
What makes the difference between the champion and a just good team?
