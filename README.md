# Project Proposal
The UEFA Champions League (UCL) is the most prestigious club competition in world football. While pundits often analyze a team's success based on luck or individual player quality, a deeper understanding requires a data-driven, historical perspective. To truly define the drivers of success and failure in the UCL, this project will analyze the statistical patterns, results, and trends that have emerged over decades.

Despite a limited personal interest in football, the outcomes of major tournaments—such as the Champions League and the Turkish Super League—often appear statistically predictable. Common observations suggest that financial dominance, exemplified by high transfer fees, and historical prestige (e.g., teams like Fenerbahçe or Galatasaray) significantly increase the probability of winning trophies. This observation led to the hypothesis that success is not random but can be modeled through quantifiable gameplay statistics. Consequently, this study aims to compare team statistics to predict tournament success, operating on the premise that a talented squad and dominant gameplay are early indicators of how far a team will progress.

By exploring the patterns of teams that successfully navigate the tournament versus those that fail, this project will attempt to identify the tangible, data-backed markers of a championship-caliber team.


# Data to be used
Generally, I am using data from 
- https://fbref.com/en/comps/8/history/Champions-League-Seasons
- https://www.transfermarkt.com/uefa-champions-league/teilnehmer/pokalwettbewerb/CL
- https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/

# What data's are going to be used
- Countries of the teams and teams qualified for round of 16
- The amount of wins and losses of the winner team in the group stage
- total goal each team scored and total goal scored against them
- the points each team collected in group stage
- expected goals and expected goals allowed by each team, also expected goal difference per 90 mins for each team
- market value of every team in each seasons
- in which step the teams elimined and the amount of goal difference causing them eliminated
- in which step the eliminating them eliminated


# Problems
- A potential bias arises when a strong team (Team A) is eliminated early, for instance in the Round of 16, simply because they faced the tournament winner. Although the champion is theoretically the strongest opponent, our current scoring system penalizes Team A for this early exit. Consequently, Team A is underrated; their true performance quality may be much higher than their final ranking suggests. I solved that problem thorugh giving a weighted sum to the elimination step. The success in knockout phase is calculated as (5 * Eliminated phase + 2 * the elimintaion sted of the team eliminitanig them - score difference). This seems to be fair to me.
- Also there is a problem in conducting t-test and linear regreesion. The teams that get eliminated in group stages has no success in knockout phase. However it does not mean they were bad at those stages since they did not have the chance. It affected the linear all the parts in my study directly. I found out how to solve that in different ways. I'll come to that when I mention them.

#Use of AI
The conceptual framework, hypotheses, and core ideas presented in this project are entirely my own. AI tools were utilized primarily for suggestions regarding additional visualizations in the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase and to refine the academic tone of the report. While the code was largely generated by AI, it was produced under my strict supervision and directed by my specific logic and workflow requirements. All interpretations, comments, and conclusions in the final report are my own original work.



# Questions
- How many teams do each country have in champions league and how many of them were able to? which country is the most successful?
- Is there a significant difference between a team eliminated in round of 16 and a finalist team in group stages? or in other words - What makes the difference between the champion and a just good team?
- Was the winner team always the best in group stage?
- What statistics make a team best in the group stage or in two leg system?
- How much valueable is a team need to be and does it always work?
